						<p>So, you&#8217;re thinking about starting a blog huh? &#160;That&#8217;s great! &#160;Wouldn&#8217;t it be easier if there was an <em><strong>example of a blog</strong></em> that you could look at as you were getting started? &#160;<strong><em>That</em></strong> is one of the purposes of this site. &#160;I&#8217;ve enjoyed blogging for quite a while now, but to be honest, I could never really choose just one topic to focus on when it came time to write new posts.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I started this site was to provide helpful information for family and friends who said that they could never start a blog of their own. I&#8217;m also giving them a place to post about their interests if they ever feel the desire to share what they&#8217;ve learned in life. As for the name, well, I just really like the idea that this is an example of a blog that anyone could start if they wanted to share something with the world. &#160;The plan is to build this site as a &#8220;real&#8221; blog about life, and to include plenty of posts about the actual nuts and bolts of how to build a successful blog in the <a href="http://exampleofablog.com/category/blogging-basics/">blogging basics</a> category. &#160;Feel free to follow along and ask any questions that come up for you!<br/>

<h2>Why Blog?</h2>
<p>There are lots of wonderful reasons for getting your own blog set up and published. &#160;In today&#8217;s world, having a blog is almost like having a business card. &#160;You can use it for any number of things.&#160;Some good reasons that pop to mind include journaling your life, creating a special place to tell the world about family events, self promotion, selling physical or informational products (making money), becoming a part of a larger community you are interested in, showing off a favorite collection&#8230; the list goes on and on. &#160;There really is not much down side to creating your own blog.<img class="size-medium wp-image-11 alignleft" title="Example of a blog" src="http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/catching_up_on_email-300x201.jpg" alt="example of a blog" width="300" height="201" srcset="http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/catching_up_on_email-300x201.jpg 300w, http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/catching_up_on_email-446x300.jpg 446w, http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/catching_up_on_email.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"/> The problem? &#160;Not knowing where to start. &#160;It stops people dead in their tracks. &#160;This site&#8217;s purpose is to help you through that fear and to get you up and running with your own blog before you know it. &#160;This example of a blog will be your &#8220;go to guide&#8221; as you enter the world of blogging. &#160;As the site grows, we&#8217;ll also take a look at some top examples of famous and not-so-famous blogs that do a good job of exploring specific niches. &#160;It will be fun and you&#8217;ll get plenty of examples and inspiration to keep you moving forward.</p>

<h2>Why Haven&#8217;t YOU Started a Blog Yet?</h2>
<p>In case you haven&#8217;t noticed, a LOT of people have already started blogs. &#160;Some people write about very specific interests, and some prefer to keep things general. &#160;As a rule, if you want to get noticed by the search engines, you&#8217;re better off starting with some type of focus, but if you prefer to go general, there&#8217;s certainly nothing stopping you except possibly your fear of the unknown. When you are just toying with the idea of starting a blog, it&#8217;s very &#160;easy to talk yourself out of starting. &#160;Most people are pretty resistant to change and to trying unfamiliar things. &#160;That&#8217;s completely natural. &#160;The thing is though, you&#8217;ve got to be willing to stretch your boundaries a bit and to explore new areas that seem intimidating as you move forward. &#160;I happen to prefer (and recommend) building your blog on a domain that you own. &#160;(I&#8217;ll go into reasons for this in another upcoming post). &#160;The truth is though, if you want to, you can start a blog for free today and it won&#8217;t cost you a dime. &#160;There is some considerable downside to this plan though, and I&#8217;ll post about it shortly, but the fact remains that you can start a blog for free if you really want to get your message out to the world.</p>
<h2>Blog Questions and Getting Unstuck</h2>
<p>Sometimes we over analyze things to the point of paralyzing ourselves. &#160;For some reason, we think that every new project we take on has to result in perfection. &#160;I think this is a big reason why many potentially wonderful bloggers end up passing on the opportunity to set up their own website. &#160;So many questions come up and there is no one trustworthy to ask. &#160;I&#8217;d like this blog to be a source of quality information that you can trust, but I&#8217;d also like it to be the motivational kick in the pants you need to get you to stop questioning every darn thing you consider trying.</p>

<h2>&#160;Something Personal for Visitors to my Blog</h2>
<p>I started creating websites back around 2005. &#160;I&#8217;m not a techno geek type at all, but I was able to figure things out and get some profitable sites set up. &#160;Many friends and relatives have shown an interest in my projects over the years. &#160;This is mostly because they noticed that I was making some money from my ventures. &#160;I willingly explained every step of setting up a site to them, but most of them are scared to get started because they don&#8217;t know where to start. This website is being built as an example for my friends. &#160;Sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words (at least). &#160;I&#8217;m hoping that this sites will provide the motivation, direction, and instructions they need to get themselves up and running with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog" target="_blank">blog</a> of their very own. &#160;If anyone else happens upon this site, I&#8217;d love to hear about what you found useful and what you think could use a tweak here and there.</p>

						<p>Sometimes I think about what might be considered &#8220;random&#8221; things. This is what popped up in my head today as I was soaking up the joy of the Christmas season, and watching my kids get totally revved up about it. What do you think would happen if every major news outlet in the world good newsput an emphasis on GOOD news for an entire month? I&#8217;m not talking about ignoring vital news, but, instead, putting their massive influence behind putting a positive spin on world events instead of a negative one.</p>
<p>I avoid watching the news on purpose. I can be fairly certain that if there is some &#8220;big&#8221; news, at least 4 people will ask me if I heard about it within a couple of hours when I go to work. Usually, they are fairly wound up about events that end up having very little, if any effect on them directly. I&#8217;d much rather focus on things that are not quite so depressing. Do you know anyone who lets the news direct how they face each day? It seems a bit silly to me. No, I don&#8217;t walk around like a Pollyanna. I just don&#8217;t walk around acting like Eeyore either because of what some bonehead did to get his 15 minutes of nightly news fame.</p>
<p>A lot of folks seriously latch on to whatever message the media feeds them on any particular day. I guess I used to be that way. I remember following all of the Bill Clinton and OJ Simpson type stories. Then, one day, I realized that I wasted hours of my life following that garbage. Why? More recently, there has been a bunch of reporting about the <img class="alignright size-full wp-image-378" alt="good news" src="http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/good-news.jpg" width="300" height="176" srcset="http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/good-news.jpg 300w, http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/good-news-250x146.jpg 250w, http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/good-news-150x88.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"/>alleged misbehavior of a Penn State football coach. My coworkers wouldn&#8217;t shut up about it. I could have gotten the complete update on the situation in about 5 minutes. They talk about it and rehash what was on the news for hours. Seriously? What if they were focused instead on some positive story that inspired them to join their efforts and do something amazing that made a difference in the lives of other people? Maybe they&#8217;d even make it on to the last five minutes of the news themselves!</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;m going to give myself a challenge. &#160;I&#8217;m going to look for <a href="http://exampleofablog.com/">positive news</a> every day that I can spread around the building at work. &#160;It doesn&#8217;t have to be news on the national level. &#160;It might be something nice about someone we all work with or a bit of happy news from my own family. &#160;I&#8217;m curious to see if I can get that to be contagious. &#160;I&#8217;ll also continue to avoid the negative Nellies of the work place as much as possible. &#160;I know that I&#8217;m risking becoming a social outcast, but I suppose I&#8217;d rather risk that than wallow in the misery and commiseration.</p>

						<p>It can be tough getting kids to read nowadays. There are so many cool electronic distractions and diversions for them to play with, that the idea of sitting down with a good book can seem sort of boring. You might not be able to convince your teenager to grab a novel right off the bat, but introducing them to some entertaining short stories might get them to start reading just for the pure joy of it.</p>
<h2>Short Stories Teens Will Enjoy</h2>
<p>When you think of short stories for teenagers, there are some classic titles that come up. I still remember reading many of these in middle school and high school simply because they were such good stories. The teachers loved them because they readily lent themselves to critical analysis. I just knew that I enjoyed them. Today, classic short stories hold a special place in my heart as a parent and teacher because they can grab a reader by their imagination almost instantly transport them to a different place and time. There isn&#8217;t room for a lot of fluff, and that&#8217;s a very good thing when you are trying to get the attention of a teenager with a million other distractions surrounding them. I&#8217;m including some newer titles here as well and I hope you&#8217;ll check them out if you haven&#8217;t already. You might also want to check out this list of short stories for teenagers. By the way, these are great for adults too! &#160;This is really just a starter list of classic short stories for teens, so please feel free to share your favorites in the comments.</p>
<h2>The Lottery</h2>
<p><strong>The classic short story by Shirley Jackson (1948)</strong><br/>
The Lottery by Shirley Jackson is a classic tale that I remember reading in middle school. It was definitely a change from my elementary readers. Although it was published way back in 1948, it still packs a punch. Today&#8217;s fans of The Hunger Games will certainly see some similarities and might be pleasantly surprised. &#160;I found an interesting analysis of The Lottery, but be warned that there ARE spoilers.<br/>

<h2>Nightfall</h2>
<p><strong>An amazing collection of short stories by Isaac Asimov</strong></p>
<p>If you are a science fiction fan, or you know a teen who is, you&#8217;ve got to read Isaac Asimov. The book shown here is a collection of some of his popular short stories. It includes the classic tale Nightfall. Some say that the storyline of Nightfall isn&#8217;t very plausible. I would say however, that the reactions of people to the unexpected can often be quite strange. The gist of the tale is that people living on a planet that never sees night are exposed to a solar eclipse. They are suddenly able to get a peek at a night sky, and their world is changed. It is not all for the good. Check it out.</p>
<h2>The Most Dangerous Game</h2>
<p><strong>Richard Connell (1924)</strong></p>
<p>What would it feel like to be hunted by another person? This classic short story from 1924 was written by Richard Connell. I love older stories like this. I often tell students that they need to see &#8220;a movie&#8221; in their heads and make a connection with what the characters are feeling and experiencing. This story can help them do that and demonstrates that you don&#8217;t have to sit in front of a 3D movie to get a horrific thrill. This story is a great example of why some things are considered classics for a reason.</p>
<h2>Cathedral</h2>
<p><strong>An unusual collection of short stories by Raymond Carver</strong></p>
<p>Raymond Carver is considered a minimalist writer. His short stories are about &#8220;regular&#8221; people. They get you to take a look at yourself and the people you see every day in a new way. This collection is a nice change of pace from the selections I&#8217;ve mentioned above.</p>
<h2>The Diamond as Big as The Ritz</h2>
<p><strong>Travel back in time with F. Scott Fitzgerald</strong></p>
<p>Not everyone likes the style of F. Scott Fitzgerald, but this short story is an interesting peek into the lives of people living an opulent lifestyle back in the 1920s.</p>
<h2>The Best of Poe</h2>
<p><strong>Must Read short stories by Edgar Allan Poe</strong><br/>
These were some of my favorite short stories back in high school. I loved reading them. This volume includes The Tell-Tale Heart, The Raven, The Cask of Amontillado, and 30 Others. If you haven&#8217;t read Poe, you really should. If you are a fan of his short stories, this is a book that you should add to your collection. I remember reading Poe as an assignment. Once I started, I couldn&#8217;t put the book down. Can you tell I&#8217;m a Poe fan?</p>
<h2>Get a teenager to read today</h2>
<p>What I&#8217;ve tried to put together is a short list of good books for teenagers. I realize that it could never really be comprehensive. A list of favorite books is always going to be somewhat subjective, but there are some really great short stories that seem to cross the barriers of demographics and that even stand the test of time.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, reading is one of the most important skills that we can learn. It helps us to get our imagination into high gear. If you are a parent reading this, encourage your children to see value in books. I have specifically focused on books for teenagers because I think that is when it is most likely that non-readers will start drifting away from reading at all. These short stories for teenagers can usually be read in a relatively short amount of time and won&#8217;t put too much of a burden on those with a limited attention span.</p>
<p>These books, as I mentioned earlier, are also a very inexpensive option when searching out gifts for teenagers. They have huge upside potential. If the person you are buying for ends up loving the book, you could be opening up new worlds for them!</p>

						<h2>Why I&#8217;m Cutting My Dog&#8217;s Hair</h2>
<p>I recently gave myself a crash course in goldendoodle grooming. &#160;I had nothing against the groomer we were using. &#160;It was purely a money saving move.<span id="more-510"/> &#160;We were spending more on dog haircuts than we were for the five humans living in our house to get their hair cut. &#160;You see, I&#8217;m a dog lover. &#160;I&#8217;ve had dogs most of my life. &#160;Mutts, purebreds, big dogs, little dogs&#8230; I love having them around. &#160;I&#8217;ve fed them, trained them, taken them to the vet as needed, and cleaned up after them a lot. &#160;The one thing I had never done however was groom them. &#160;Well, I&#8217;ve bathed and</p>
<div id="attachment_512" style="width: 259px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-full wp-image-512" src="http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Goldendoodle-grooming.jpg" alt="goldendoodle grooming" width="249" height="300" srcset="http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Goldendoodle-grooming.jpg 249w, http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Goldendoodle-grooming-124x150.jpg 124w, http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Goldendoodle-grooming-41x50.jpg 41w" sizes="(max-width: 249px) 100vw, 249px"/><p class="wp-caption-text">This is Daisy after she went prospecting for dog kibble in an empty bag. Yes, she got her head stuck, but she really is a pretty intelligent dog!</p></div>
<p>brushed them, but I never owned a dog that required a haircut. &#160;That is, until my family welcomed our goldendoodle, Daisy, into our house a few years ago. &#160;I didn&#8217;t realize that we&#8217;d be paying for grooming expenses every other month.</p>
<h2>Grooming Goldendoodles</h2>
<p>Before we bought Daisy, we did a lot of research on this breed that some people consider a glorified mutt (hey, I didn&#8217;t say it). &#160;As a mix between a golden retriever and a standard poodle, they&#8217;ve got intelligence and a friendly demeanor going for them. &#160;They&#8217;ve also got one heck of a coat of hair.&#160; No one told us that the cute little puffball puppy would turn into a mop if her hair was allowed to grow wild. &#160;I must have glossed over that fact when I was doing research on the breed, but it became apparent early on that she would require some clipping if we didn&#8217;t want her to become a matted mess. &#160;It turns out that goldendoodle grooming costs about seventy dollars around these parts. &#160;After making several of these payments every eight to ten weeks, I finally started to&#160;think that it might be a good idea to learn how to cut dog hair myself. &#160;About a month ago, I dug out the grooming appointment card from my wallet and cancelled Daisy&#8217;s grooming appointment. &#160;I started looking for articles and videos about&#160;grooming a goldendoodle and I spent hours reading pet clipper reviews. &#160;You have to schedule these grooming appointments weeks in advance, so I was pretty much committed to following through after the cancellation.</p>
<h2>How to Groom a Goldendoodle</h2>
<p>I read many articles and forum posts about grooming techniques, but I&#8217;m very much a visual learner when it comes to things like how to groom a dog. &#160; A month ago I had no idea how to groom a dog with clippers. &#160;I&#8217;m certainly not an expert at it now, but I feel confident enough to give my dog a haircut and keep the seventy bucks for other things. &#160;I followed the tips given in the video below and on the dvd that came with my clippers. &#160; This is the best series of videos about goldendoodle&#160;grooming that I came across as I scoured the internet. &#160;The lady doing the grooming made a series of these (they&#8217;ll appear as related videos after the video ends. &#160;Just look for &#8220;Grooming Sully&#8221; in the videos.) &#160;I think she does a great job of explaining how to groom a goldendoodle.<br/>

<h2>What are the Best Dog Clippers?</h2>
<p>Once I had given up our scheduled grooming time, I started to feel some pressure. &#160;I realized that I needed to buy some pet clippers, but I had no idea where to begin. &#160;I started with the idea that I&#8217;d look for something inexpensive (really not the best strategy in this case). &#160;I&#160;checked Craigslist, but I was unimpressed with the couple of listings that I found. &#160;To be honest, I wasn&#8217;t crazy about the risk of buying used clippers anyway. &#160;I prefer to have the option to return something if it doesn&#8217;t do what I need it to do. &#160;As it turned out, that was a pretty good policy to have.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-513" src="http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/best-dog-clippers.jpg" alt="what are the best dog clippers?" width="300" height="184" srcset="http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/best-dog-clippers.jpg 300w, http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/best-dog-clippers-244x150.jpg 244w, http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/best-dog-clippers-150x92.jpg 150w, http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/best-dog-clippers-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"/>Still working with the idea that I&#8217;d get some inexpensive clippers with good reviews, I headed over to Amazon. &#160;I&#8217;ll tell you right now that this is a bad idea if you have a dog with a heavy or coarse coat like most goldendoodles. &#160;I don&#8217;t know why I went in with a cheap mindset. &#160;The dog groomer was costing us $420 per year! &#160;I could have easily bought the most expensive professional clippers available and come out ahead after a year of haircuts. &#160;Anyway, I went for a set of Wahl clippers that cost about $50. &#160;They claimed to be in their &#8220;pro series&#8221;, so I thought they were professional grade. &#160;They really weren&#8217;t. &#160; They had gotten good reviews, but apparently the people using them were doing some light duty work. &#160;After the clippers arrived, my daughter and I headed out to the back yard with Daisy and the clippers. &#160;They didn&#8217;t cut through Daisy&#8217;s hair at all. &#160;Even though I had followed the directions about washing, drying, and combing our dog, the cheap clippers just could not clip through the hair. &#160;We gave up after about 30 frustrating minutes. &#160;I packed up the clippers and returned them to Amazon. &#160;By the way, they were very good about the return. &#160;I just clicked a few buttons and received an instant refund. &#160;They even arrange for package pickup at their cost. &#160;I was disappointed with the clippers, but impressed with the customer service.</p>
<h2>Next Up, The Andis AGC 2</h2>
<p>So, it was back to the drawing board, and I felt like I could see Daisy&#8217;s hair growing by the day. &#160;She has sort of a mix</p>
<div id="attachment_514" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0018KVI5M/?tag=homereview-20"><img class="wp-image-514 size-full" src="http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/andis-agc2-clippers.jpg" alt="andis agc2 clippers" width="300" height="243" srcset="http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/andis-agc2-clippers.jpg 300w, http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/andis-agc2-clippers-185x150.jpg 185w, http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/andis-agc2-clippers-150x121.jpg 150w, http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/andis-agc2-clippers-50x40.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">These are the Andis clippers I ended up keeping. They work great! Click on the photo to see them on Amazon. There are also a TON of other reviews there.</p></div>
<p>between curly and wavy hair and when I can see noticeable curls, I start to worry that matting can&#8217;t be &#160;far off. &#160;I dug back into my research without such a cheap mindset. &#160;It seemed that &#8220;real&#8221; professional groomers leaned toward clippers made either by Oster or Andis. &#160;I didn&#8217;t have any bias as I started this adventure, but many people mentioned that getting quiet pet clippers was a good idea. &#160;Andis seemed to be the clear winner in that category (with most other things being equal) so I ended up purchasing some Andis professional clippers. &#160;Specifically, I bought the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0018KVI5M/?tag=homereview-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Andis AGC 2-Speed Pet Clipper</a>. &#160;(That link will show you product specifics and reviews I found on Amazon.) &#160;This &#160;Andis clipper set came with a number 10 blade (which you would use to do a VERY short cut down to the skin). &#160;I bought some clipper combs to go along with them that allow you to adjust how long you leave the hair because I didn&#8217;t want Daisy to end up looking like a naked mole rat. &#160;The clipper combs were actually suggested by Amazon when I was checking out, otherwise I might not have thought of buying them.</p>
<p>The clippers arrived in a few days and we headed back outside to try clipping Daisy again. &#160;The results this time were MUCH better. &#160;The Andis clipper blades went through Daisy&#8217;s fur like a hot knife through butter! &#160;As a bonus, the clippers really were VERY quiet. &#160;Much quieter than the cheap clippers I had purchased and then returned. &#160;I didn&#8217;t know what comb to start with, so there was a little bit of trial and error until I got things figured out. &#160;I finally decided that I liked the number 7 comb. &#160;It took the hair down below the point of curling but didn&#8217;t leave her looking &#8220;shaved&#8221;. &#160;Now that I&#8217;ve decided that I really like these Andis clippers, I&#8217;m going to purchase an actual number 7 blade that will fit onto the clippers. &#160;That, along with the number 10 blade that came with the clippers, should take care of any clipping needs we&#8217;ll have. &#160;Andis ceramic blades also received very good reviews, and I feel comfortable purchasing them now that I&#8217;ve seen the Andis AGC2&#160; clippers in action. &#160;So, I guess I can sum this all up by saying that I am very happy with my Andis 2 speed dog clippers. &#160;They met the challenge of goldendoodle hair and performed better than I expected. &#160;They were also so quiet that Daisy never even flinched when I brought them close to her ears. &#160;I definitely give these dog clippers two thumbs up! &#160;If you are interested in reading more about them, <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0018KVI5M/?tag=homereview-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CLICK HERE</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>A note on shipping</strong></p>
<p>This might vary depending on where you live, but I chose the free shipping when I was checking out. &#160;The estimated delivery time was 5 &#8211; 8 days, but I figured I could live with that if it saved me shipping costs. &#160;The actual free delivery time was actually only 3 days. &#160;Definitely a pleasant surprise. &#160;If you aren&#8217;t in a major hurry, I&#8217;d recommend trying the free shipping option if you buy your clippers from Amazon like I did.</p>

						<h2>Looking for the Best Way to Catch a Mouse?</h2>
<p>So, you want to know how to get rid of mice in your house? Well, it is little comfort to hear that the best strategy is to not let mice in your house to begin with, so I&#8217;ll save those tips until the end. &#160;If you are not used to dealing with these nasty little critters, seeing mice in the house for the first time can really freak you out. &#160;Figuring out how to get rid of mice becomes a top priority in a hurry. &#160;I remember the first time I saw one up close and personal. I was five or six years old and our house was next to woods. My older sister and I were watching TV in the game room when we saw a gray streak go sprinting across the floor. My sister about lost her mind right there. I didn&#8217;t know what it was until I heard her screaming MOUSE!</p>
<p>Anyway, if you&#8217;ve got mice in the house, you&#8217;ll want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. They are quite attracted to each other if you know what I mean. I&#8217;ve read that if you don&#8217;t take steps quickly to get rid of mice, they can have up to twelve or thirteen litters over the course of a year. That means that they can quickly become more than a nuisance. &#160;You can find yourself living in the middle of a full blown mouse control problem. Mice can spread some very nasty diseases, and they can get into just about anything. You want them gone. If you have been looking for a reason to get a cat, you&#8217;re all set.</p>

<h2>How to Get Rid of Mice: Mouse Traps That Work</h2>
<p>At this point some of you might be curling up in your chair feeling something like my sister did when she saw our little visitor. Now you have to decide on a course of action. You could go straight to calling a mouse exterminator, but that can be expensive. Depending on your situation, you might want to try taking care of things on your own first. &#160;Whatever you decide to do, you need to take action quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Spring Loaded Mouse Traps</strong></p>
<p>Probably the most common solution that people go with, when it comes to mouse extermination, is a spring loaded mouse trap. Victor mouse traps are probably the ones most Americans are familiar with. &#160;The Victor &#8220;V&#8221; is well known with experienced mouse hunters. &#160;These mouse traps are efficient and cheap. &#160;In my opinion, these are the<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-477" src="http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/mouse-trap.jpg" alt="mouse trap" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/mouse-trap.jpg 300w, http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/mouse-trap-225x150.jpg 225w, http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/mouse-trap-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"/> best way to catch a mouse. &#160;If you want to give these a shot, place them near where the mice hang out. If you know of a hole where they are living, place the mouse trap near it. If you just know a general area where you have seen mice, place it along the area where they run. &#160;For these mouse traps to do any good, you will have to find the best mouse trap bait for the mouse in your house. &#160;I have found that marshmallows with peanut butter smeared on top of them make a pretty good mouse trap bait. &#160;It stays in place and does a good job of getting the attention of hungry mice. &#160;You may want to secure the mouse bait in place by tying it down with a piece of dental floss (not mint flavored). &#160;I&#8217;ve also heard of some people adding a drop of vanilla extract to the mouse bait just to make it a bit more irresistible to the mice. From what I&#8217;ve seen, baiting a mouse trap with cheese works a lot better in cartoons than it does in real life. You want something sticky that smells good to them. If you have other pets, make sure that their access to the trap area is blocked. &#160;This tip about protecting other pets also applies to using poison pellets, mouse glue traps, and any other pest control products that could potentially harm them. &#160;Mouse poison and dogs should be nowhere near each other. &#160;Your pets may also go after baited mouse traps, so be sure to take precautions.</p>
<h2>How to Set a Mouse Trap</h2>
<p>One of the most daunting parts of the whole &#8220;how to catch a mouse&#8221; problem is how to set a mouse trap. &#160;I&#8217;ll bet that there are people who avoid these snap traps just because they don&#8217;t want to whack themselves. &#160;Fortunately, I was able to find a very handy video showing the right way to set a trap (along with what NOT to do). &#160;Take a look. &#160;A picture (or video) is worth a thousand words!<br/>

<h3><strong>How to Get Rid of Mice with an Electronic Mouse trap</strong></h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve all heard the challenge of building a better mousetrap, and people keep on trying. There are electronic mouse traps that use battery power to deliver a lethal jolt. &#160;You might also hear these referred to as electric mouse traps, but they do not plug in to a wall socket. &#160;These are a good option for people who prefer to avoid the possible gore of a traditional trap. Once the mouse is dead, you just dump it out and dispose of it properly. There are also various no touch traps that work something like a traditional trap. I have found that the electronic traps are hard to find in my area. &#160;These run on standard batteries, but they build up a charge that is strong enough to take down these rodents. &#160;Some people have managed to give themselves a zap while setting these, so be careful. &#160;The Victor Electronic Mouse Trap is one of the more popular choices around today.</p>
<p><strong>Looking for a Humane Mouse Trap?</strong></p>
<p>There are some people who don&#8217;t want mice in the house, but who cannot bear the thought of causing suffering in another living creature. &#160;For these people, there are humane mouse traps. &#160;Now, the definition of humane can vary a bit here. &#160;If you search for them, you will not always find <em>live</em> mouse traps. &#160;Some people see anything that is not a spring loaded trap as humane, while others want a trap that will capture the mice in a living state so that they can be relocated to some nearby woods and live out their lives as country mice. &#160;I&#8217;ll assume for now that we are talking about live capture traps. &#160;There are quite a few available. &#160; My problem with trapping mice is that these traps are going to leave you stuck with a trapped animal that is not going to show you the proper appreciation for sparing its life. &#160;I get the noble cause. &#160;Honestly, I even carry spiders outside sometimes, but I personally am not interested in an accidental mouse bite as I try to do the right thing. &#160;I switch into a different mode when I&#8217;m dealing with pest problems.</p>
<p>Probably the most popular and affordable humane traps around are Mice Cubes (cute name). &#160;Mice cubes work on a pretty basic principal. &#160;The door only opens one way. &#160;When the mouse goes in, gravity closes the door behind it and then it is stuck. &#160;At that point, you can drive it to your favorite wooded area and introduce it to its new home. &#160;At the time of this writing, you can pick up a 12 pack of these for just over 20 bucks. &#160;Smaller packs cost less. &#160;Not a bad deal at all if you want to get your mouse problems handled as quickly as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Glue Mouse Traps</strong></p>
<p>I should also acknowledge that there are glue mouse traps available. &#160;Seriously, the idea of these glue traps for mice gives me the heeby jeebies. &#160;These allow you to capture a living mouse by getting it stuck to a board covered with glue. &#160;Do you want to guess what kind of mood this critter will be when you find it? &#160;Really, some people like these traps, but pretty much anything that goes by can get stuck to them, and like I said, you&#8217;ve got to deal with an angry rodent that is basically out in the open. &#160;Surprisingly, I never saw this mentioned in other how to articles about mouse trapping or rat trapping. &#160;I can&#8217;t say that I recommend this method, but if you have a reason that you prefer them, please feel free to leave a comment explaining why.</p>
<p><strong>Mouse Poison</strong></p>
<p>Finally there is the mouse poison option. I&#8217;ve never actually tried any of these for two reasons. I have had dogs around for most of my life, and I don&#8217;t want the mice dying and rotting somewhere that I can&#8217;t find them. I may be paranoid, but I don&#8217;t like to leave poison out where kids or pets can get to it. Your situation may vary. &#160;I happen to know that if I accidentally leave any type of bait stations out in the open, &#160;at least one of my dogs will probably get curious enough to do itself some harm. &#160;Before you even consider using poison, please <a href="http://www.rodalenews.com/d-con" target="_blank">read this</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Homemade Mouse Trap</strong></p>
<p>OK. &#160;You know that there are people who just have to try things on their own. &#160;Honestly, my research on homemade mouse traps seems to indicate that most of them are a lot more trouble than they are worth. &#160;Some were based on making the mouse drown, which I do see as rather cruel and unusual, or trapping them in something like a garbage can. &#160;Considering how inexpensive traps actually are, these might make for a nice science fair project, but they hardly seem worth the time and effort involved.</p>
<p><strong>What is the best mouse trap?</strong></p>
<p>I suppose choosing the best mouse trap is something that depends a lot on your ethical position on killing mice. &#160;If you are against it, go for one of the live release traps. &#160;If you are only interested in how to kill mice efficiently, I personally lean toward the spring loaded traps or electronic traps. &#160;I&#8217;d have to say that if I face the problem any time soon, I&#8217;ll probably give the electronic traps a shot just because they don&#8217;t really cost that much and I always feel like I&#8217;m going to snap myself when I set the spring traps.</p>
<p>No matter how you decide to go after the mice, don&#8217;t handle them without protecting yourself with heavy gloves. (Read about <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/rodents/cleaning/" target="_blank">cleaning up after rodents</a>.) They really can carry some bad stuff. When I&#8217;ve caught them in the past, I drop them into double plastic bags, wrap them up and put them in the outside garbage. I have also heard that vacuums should not be used to clean up their droppings. Apparently they can release some of the bad stuff from the droppings into the air and you don&#8217;t want to breath it in. Spray it with a disinfectant spray containing bleach and then clean it up with disposable rags or paper towels. Have I made it clear that you don&#8217;t want to handle any of this stuff more than you have to?</p>
<p><strong>How to Keep Mice Out of Your House</strong></p>
<p>As for how to keep mice out of your house once you have done your Terminator thing, removing clutter is a good way to start. Trash and piles of wood are common things that attract mice. Keep them away from your house as much as possible. If you do keep wood for a fireplace, get it off of the ground where it would make an inviting home for Stuart Little&#8217;s bad seed cousins.</p>
<p>In addition, look for points around your house where mice might be gaining access and seal them. They can fit through incredibly tiny holes, so get yourself some caulking or other appropriate sealant and get busy. &#160; They can chew through most of the materials used in building a house with the exception of metal, so if you can block entryways with something metallic, it is all the better. &#160;Also, clean up anything that might be an attractive food source for these pests. Dog and cat food are notorious attractants. I remember when my brother found a nest of mice living under the hood of his 1979 Cougar RX7. He said that there was bunch of dog kibble stored in there along with the mice. I have also had mice raiding the dog food in past years, but they never got quite so creative with their accommodations.</p>
<p><strong>Mice in the Walls</strong></p>
<p>Not to spook you, but have you ever heard a mysterious scratching noise in the middle of the night, when the house was quiet? &#160;Well, it could be mice in your <a href="http://www.orkin.com/rodents/mouse-control/how-to-get-mice-out-of-house-walls/" target="_blank">walls</a>. &#160;Of course, it could also be squirrels or bats too, but that&#8217;s another post. &#160;Solutions for getting rid of mice in walls can be a bit more challenging. &#160;They could be trapped, or they could just be using the area as part of their normal run. &#160;If you can locate where they entered, setting a trap is probably your best bet. &#160;Once they are gone, just be sure to seal things up tight so that no more visitors come calling. &#160;If they are not willing to cooperate and get into the mouse trap for you, you do have some other options. &#160;If you can find a place (in the attic maybe) where you can access the space between the walls, you could sprinkle some mouse poison in there for them. &#160;The problem with that of course is that they might also die between the walls. &#160;Some mouse poisons have a drying effect on the mouse&#8217;s body, but you may still have to put up with some stink for several days. &#160;Some people swear by doing the same thing with moth balls because the seem to repel mice. &#160;I recently heard about using peppermint oil to repel mice. &#160;I&#8217;d probably give that a try first, just because I the smell of moth balls might drive me out of the house before the mice left. &#160;Some people are looking for ways to get rid of mice naturally. &#160;Well, besides a cat, I guess one of these methods would be your best bet. &#160;I cannot vouch for it yet, but I will be putting some peppermint oil soaked cotton balls around possible points of entry when the weather starts to turn cold.</p>
<p>EDIT: I came across this video and just had to share it. The still shot looks gruesome, I know, but if you&#8217;ve never seen this before, you&#8217;ve got to check it out! &#160;Watch til the end. &#160;It isn&#8217;t what you think.</p>

						<p>Interior Design Books can help the novice designer as well as the experienced professional in creating unique interior designs to fit any d&#233;cor. Whether one wants a traditional or modern interior design, the right books can provide the guidance one needs in creating the perfect living room, bedroom, dining room or any other room in the home. Even business establishments can benefit from interior design ideas in order to make their offices more inviting and productive to employees as well as customers.</p>
<p><strong>What Can Interior Design Do for Your Home?</strong><br/>
<object width="560" height="315" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"/><param name="src" value="//www.youtube.com/v/vKX7VpjV0ZI?hl=en_US&amp;version=3"/><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"/><embed width="560" height="315" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="//www.youtube.com/v/vKX7VpjV0ZI?hl=en_US&amp;version=3" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always"/></object></p>
<p><strong>What Room is Getting the Makeover?</strong></p>
<p>When looking for the right books on interior design, it is important to consider what room or rooms need a makeover. For instance, if one wants to give the living room a new twist, a book with furniture ideas such as couches, sofas, coffee tables and other common items found in this area should be first on the list. A book that has ideas for wall art or flooring styles most compatible with a preferred style should also be considered.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s Your Style?</strong></p>
<p>It is also possible to look for books based on particular decorating styles. For example, Oriental designs are popular in many households, so finding a book with Oriental design concepts and Asian furniture decorating ideas can be useful. These books can help designers find benches and stools, wooden screens and dividers or cabinets and armoires with distinct Asian designs. One may also find out what Asian inspired art such as ceramic pots, tapestries, carved statues, folding screens, jade pieces and many other decorative accents go best with the chosen decorative motif or theme.</p>
<p><strong>Interior Design is for Business Too!</strong></p>
<p>Businesses also benefit from paying attention to their interior designs. An office&#8217;s atmosphere can affect the way business is conducted. Having a comfortable and cozy homelike feel to an office may put potential clients or customers at ease. &#160;The interior design can also say volumes about the business itself from sophisticated and elegant to casual and relaxed. Choosing books that show business owners how to choose and create d&#233;cor can be a great business asset, especially since first impressions are critical to businesses.</p>
<p><strong>Get the Details</strong></p>
<p>Books on interior design need to be thorough with their ideas. If one is looking for ideas on creating a perfect bedroom, it should include ideas beyond that of wall decorations to <img class="size-medium wp-image-306 alignright" alt="interior design ideas" src="http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mazzali_children_and_teenagers_bedrooms-300x234.jpg" width="300" height="234" srcset="http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mazzali_children_and_teenagers_bedrooms-300x234.jpg 300w, http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mazzali_children_and_teenagers_bedrooms-192x150.jpg 192w, http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mazzali_children_and_teenagers_bedrooms.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"/>include suggestions on bedding, floor ideas, window treatments, <a href="http://exampleofablog.com/led-icicle-lights/">lighting</a> and all the other elements that will tie together a room to create the type of haven one wants in a bedroom. Those who like to mix and match styles should also look for books that can accommodate eclectic tastes in a way that works.</p>
<p>There are many Interior Design Books on the market, so choosing the right one will be just as important as creating the d&#233;cor itself. From children&#8217;s playrooms to restaurant dining rooms, the right theme or motif can bring a completely new element to a home or business. Those who are new to decorating can benefit from these books as well as those looking for fresh ideas and innovations in the world of interior decorating.</p>

						<h2>Why Do Manners Matter?</h2>
<p>This sounds like a question you would ask in a kindergarten class, but there are plenty of grown ups who don&#8217;t understand that using good manners and being polite actually helps daily routines to run more smoothly. &#160;Treating people and property &#160;with respect takes just a little bit of effort, but the payoff can be a much happier and productive workplace. &#160;In some of my other&#160;posts, I&#8217;ve mentioned that I am, in fact, still part of the full time workforce. &#160;Yes, I have not broken totally free yet, but I&#8217;m getting there. &#160;Today I thought I&#8217;d write something that could really serve my fellow workers. &#160;What follows are some simple workplace etiquette rules, tips, and guidelines that even an idiot should be able to follow and understand (not that you&#8217;d have any of them working with you).<br/>
<object width="420" height="315"><param name="movie" value="//www.youtube.com/v/xAVcCZa5MlE?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0"/><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"/><embed src="//www.youtube.com/v/xAVcCZa5MlE?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="420" height="315" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"/></object></p>
<h2>Office Etiquette for Dummies</h2>
<p>Now, I don&#8217;t want to have a bitter tone, really. &#160;But there are some things that people do that just amaze me. &#160;Am I wrong in assuming that there are some things that you should know by the time you enter kindergarten? &#160;You know, things like clean up after yourself and don&#8217;t take other people&#8217;s stuff? &#160;We used to call it common courtesy, but it<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-525" src="http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/etiquette-at-work.jpg" alt="etiquette at work" width="257" height="300" srcset="http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/etiquette-at-work.jpg 257w, http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/etiquette-at-work-128x150.jpg 128w, http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/etiquette-at-work-42x50.jpg 42w" sizes="(max-width: 257px) 100vw, 257px"/> doesn&#8217;t seem to be too common anymore. &#160;Maybe I&#8217;m just out of touch. &#160;I see that there are actually Powerpoints and videos available for addressing this topic, so I guess it&#8217;s pretty bad. &#160;Anyway, here is a list of workplace etiquette rules that is suitable for framing or taping on to the wall or a table in your lunch room. &#160;Good manners for adults&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kitchen etiquette at work.</strong>&#160; You aren&#8217;t six years old. &#160;I really don&#8217;t want to spend five minutes cleaning up your crumbs and drippings after you&#8217;ve left. &#160;If there is a sink and you use dishes or cups, clean them. &#160;I&#8217;m not your Mama.</li>
<li><strong>Wash your hands after you go to the bathroom.</strong> &#160;Yes, I&#8217;m writing this because there is one guy where I work who I&#8217;ve seen leave the bathroom several times without washing his hands after &#8220;taking care of business&#8221; and then head straight to the lunch room. &#160;Gross.</li>
<li><strong>Whistling at work.</strong> &#160;Just please don&#8217;t. &#160;Keep that song in your heart and we&#8217;ll all be happier. &#160;You&#8217;re not working with Snow White.</li>
<li><strong>Pooping at work etiquette.</strong>&#160; Also known as &#8220;restroom etiquette in the workplace.&#8221; &#160;If you make a &#8220;mess&#8221;, for Pete&#8217;s sake, don&#8217;t leave it for me to find. &#160;Really. &#160;We had a person who did this at work. &#160;It didn&#8217;t take long for an informal &#8220;task force&#8221; to be formed with the mission of figuring out who &#8220;The Phantom&#8221; was. &#160;We&#8217;re not going to clap for you when we find what you left. &#160;Please flush (twice if needed).</li>
<li><strong>Use proper phone etiquette in the workplace.</strong> &#160;When you answer the telephone, &#8220;Yeah?&#8221; just doesn&#8217;t cut it. &#160;It&#8217;s unprofessional and it makes you sound like a moron. &#160;Take three seconds to let me know who I&#8217;m speaking to. &#160;It could be as simple as &#8220;Hello. &#160;Human resources. &#160;This is Skippy speaking.&#8221; &#160;Now was that so hard? &#160;Get yourself some phone manners.</li>
<li><strong>Shake hands like you mean it.</strong> &#160;When you are introduced to someone, offer your hand and give them a firm handshake. &#160;None of that cold, limp fish stuff either. &#160;It gives the first impression that you are some type of weak minded weasel.</li>
<li><strong>Address others at work in a respectful manner.</strong> &#160;When you are introduced to someone, along with offering a handshake, you should introduce yourself and say hello to the person. &#160;When you do this, use the other person&#8217;s full name until they give you the OK to just call them by their first name. &#160;It might go something like this&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct:</strong></p>
<p>Office manager: &#160;Mr. Skippy McMillan, I&#8217;d like to introduce you to our newest associate, Ms. Suzy Snowflake!</p>
<p>You: &#160;Hello Ms. Snowflake. &#160;It&#8217;s very nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>Incorrect:</strong></p>
<p>Office manager: &#160;Mr. Skippy McMillan, I&#8217;d like to introduce you to our newest associate, Ms. Suzy Snowflake!</p>
<p>You: &#160;<strong><em>Sweeeet!</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t lie to people.</strong> &#160;Integrity is important in all facets of life. &#160;Trust is easily broken and almost impossible to repair. &#160;Your life at work will be miserable if no one trusts you.</li>
<li><strong>Remember that you are not in a locker room.</strong> &#160;You may not have a problem with foul language, but some other people really don&#8217;t like it. &#160;Watch your language and don&#8217;t say inappropriate things to other people. &#160;Even if you don&#8217;t like being there, act like a professional. &#160;People probably do NOT find you amusing. &#160;They are waiting for you to leave so they can discuss what a jerk you are.</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t gossip at work.</strong> &#160;You really shouldn&#8217;t gossip anywhere, but we all know that it does happen (see previous item). &#160;Getting yourself known as the office gossip is a great way to make sure that no one will want to deal with you. &#160;Resist that urge to talk smack on other people.</li>
<li><strong>Mind your own business.</strong> &#160;Don&#8217;t eavesdrop. &#160;Just don&#8217;t. &#160;If you do, you&#8217;re a weasel.</li>
<li><strong>Save your 2 cents.</strong> &#160;There are times that your opinion is needed and even desired. &#160;Other times though, you should really just keep your mouth shut. &#160;If you walk into a room where a conversation is taking place, don&#8217;t immediately jump into it if it isn&#8217;t appropriate.</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t boast.</strong> &#160;If you want to share some good news, that&#8217;s great, but people who boast are not impressive. &#160;Everyone will think you&#8217;re a jerk.</li>
<li><strong>Table manners are not just for Grandma&#8217;s house at Thanksgiving.</strong> &#160;If you eat in an area where others are eating, don&#8217;t be a pig. &#160;If you don&#8217;t have any basic table manners, read <a href="http://aces.nmsu.edu/4h/documents/a204-hers20guide20to20basic20table20manners.pdf" target="_blank">this</a> and then come back.</li>
<li><strong>Put things back where they were, in the condition you found them.</strong> &#160;Need to borrow a stapler? &#160;Fine. &#160;Just bring it back in working order.</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t jam the copier and then leave.</strong> &#160;I think there should be a special little corner in the netherworld for people who do this. &#160;Did you ever see Full Metal Jacket? &#160;You know the part where they held the guy down and hit him with bars of soap wrapped in a pillow case because he was causing everyone so much grief? &#160;Yeah&#8230; If you jam it, clear it.</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t interrupt, ignore people, skip appointments, show up late or otherwise act like a total inconsiderate jackwagon.</strong> &#160;Self explanatory.</li>
<li><strong>Basic hygiene in the workplace.</strong> &#160;Wear deodorant. &#160;Don&#8217;t cover yourself in obnoxious amounts of perfume or cologne. &#160;Brush your teeth and buy some mints if you like to eat smelly things. &#160;Please don&#8217;t do things like floss your teeth, brush your hair, scratch yourself, apply makeup, or any other &#8220;personal&#8221; activity where I have to watch you do it. &#160;I was once eating lunch at a table when a woman across from me took off both of her sweaty shoes, placed them on the table and proceeded to remove and then re-insert the Odor Eater insoles. &#160;She actually set the insoles on the table and they left moisture marks about 6 inches from my sandwich. &#160;Truly foul.</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t take other people&#8217;s food.</strong> &#160;This is another one that you&#8217;d imagine adults wouldn&#8217;t actually do. &#160;Surprise. &#160;We had a lunch thief who stole several lunches a few years ago. &#160;A pregnant co-worker had her lunch heisted twice in one week. &#160;She was not a happy camper. &#160;Listen, you&#8217;ve got a job, spend some money on peanut butter and jelly. &#160;Don&#8217;t steal food (or anything) from other people.</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t rat people out to the boss.</strong> &#160;Obviously if there is something serious going on, you need to let the proper people know, but I&#8217;m talking about those special employees who make regular &#8220;behind closed doors&#8221; visits to the boss to fill them in on all of the things they &#8220;overheard&#8221;. &#160;I think there is at least one in every workplace.</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t be a cheap jerk.</strong> &#160;If everyone is pitching in for something like a gift (and you intend to sign your name on the card) or something for the office that you are going to use, just pry a few bucks out of your wallet. &#160;Most things you&#8217;d pitch in for at work don&#8217;t cost that much and they usually benefit everyone. &#160;Here is an example. &#160;Almost everyone where I worked pitched in five to ten bucks to get one of those single cup Keurig coffee makers and some K-Cups. &#160;A few people didn&#8217;t, but still feel free to use the machine and even hit up the K-Cups. &#160;If you do things like that, you are being a stinky human being and people will think your a jerk. &#160;Sorry.</li>
<li><strong>Pay attention to people.</strong> &#160;When someone is talking to you, give them your full attention. &#160;Don&#8217;t fiddle with your phone or suddenly turn away and start talking to someone else.</li>
<li><strong>Mind your cubicle.</strong> &#160;If you work in an office that utilizes cubicles, pretend like each little area is an apartment. &#160;No one wants to hear your music or your phone conversations. &#160;They also don&#8217;t want to deal with any distracting smells that might be wafting out of your area.</li>
<li><strong>Keep your personal life personal most of the time.</strong> &#160;It honestly doesn&#8217;t bother me when people start talking to me about their life outside of work most of the time, but I know that there are some people who broadcast every blessed detail to everyone within earshot. &#160;Don&#8217;t do that.</li>
</ul>

<p>Really, things would &#160;run so much more smoothly at work if everyone would just follow the idea of treating other people the way that you want to be treated. &#160;That goes for etiquette, common courtesy, and life in general. &#160;What&#8217;s so hard about that? &#160;I don&#8217;t have an exact formula, but I&#8217;d say that if you saw yourself in more than a couple of the items listed above, you may be more annoying than you realize. &#160;Try taking a new approach and see how it affects your popularity in the workplace. &#160;Good luck.</p>

						<h2>LED Icicle Lights: The Basics</h2>
<div id="attachment_313" style="width: 234px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-313 " alt="LED icicle lights" src="http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/25th_september_268365-224x300.jpg" width="224" height="300" srcset="http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/25th_september_268365-224x300.jpg 224w, http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/25th_september_268365-112x150.jpg 112w, http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/25th_september_268365.jpg 767w" sizes="(max-width: 224px) 100vw, 224px"/><p class="wp-caption-text">This is NOT a recommended use for LED icicle lights.</p></div>
<p>LED Christmas lights, sometimes referred to as LED icicle lights, have grown rapidly in popularity in recent years. There are actually two distinct types of lights that are popularly known by this name.&#160; First are the tiny lights dangling from wires, which when suspended create a net-like effect. Also widely known as LED icicle lights are LED lights that are actually made to resemble icicles. In order to avoid confusion, some people refer to the former type of light as &#8216;net&#8217; LED lights.</p>
<p>LED is an acronym for &#8216;light emitting diode&#8217;, which produces light on a different basic principle than do incandescent or fluorescent lights. Light emitting diode work by the movement of electrons through semiconductor material. They have no filaments as in an incandescent light, nor do they contain gases, as in a fluorescent or neon type light.</p>

<p><object width="420" height="315" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"/><param name="src" value="//www.youtube.com/v/urvBdY7v4a4?version=3&amp;hl=en_US"/><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"/><embed width="420" height="315" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="//www.youtube.com/v/urvBdY7v4a4?version=3&amp;hl=en_US" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always"/></object></p>
<h2>Why are LED Lights So Popular?</h2>
<p>Part of the reason for the popularity of LED Christmas lights is that they can be placed safely where children can touch them, as they don&#8217;t get hot. They also produce a brighter, more intense light than do other types of light. They can be found in various colors, such as white, which is far and away the most common,&#160; as well as blue, red, green and orange.&#160; The orange lights are actually getting a lot of use among Halloween fans!</p>
<p>Many people have found that the net style lights, in particular, are useful for more than Christmas displays. Many brides find the effect of the white net lights to be a desirable look for their reception areas. Some people like to use red, white and blue LED lights in patriotic displays.</p>
<h2>Will LED Icicle Lights Last?</h2>
<p>Many LED Christmas light manufacturers like to claim that their lights will last hundreds of thousands of hours. Such claims make it more palatable for buyers to shell out the higher cost demanded for these lights. However, the claims of such longevity ought to be taken with a grain or two of salt. While these lights may indeed deliver the promised performance under laboratory conditions, many users of these as outdoor Christmas lights find that they don&#8217;t last that long. The problem is not so much with the diodes themselves. In the real world, the plastic elements of the lights, which may be of varying quality, are subject to the rigors of the weather, not to mention being stored in sweltering attics for ten or eleven months of the year.</p>
<h2>Are They Worth the Money?</h2>
<p>In the end, many people will ask themselves if the potential savings in electric expense makes if worthwhile to junk a perfectly good set of incandescent lights to replace them with newly purchased icicle lights. Despite the claims of the manufacturers, it&#8217;s not clear that such a switch would make economic sense. However, every year there are advances in LED light technology and prices come down. Also, retailers routinely knock down the prices of Christmas lights after the season has passed.Nevertheless, if you do shell out for these icicle lights, it&#8217;s a certainty that your electric bill will receive less of a jolt over the holidays than if you were to go with incandescent lights. Although research into the relative efficiency of LED lights has been conducted by the US Department of Energy and many others, it&#8217;s hard to find a consensus owing to the number of variables that have to be accounted for, heat being perhaps the chief among them. Suffice it to say that your electric bill will be at least somewhat lower if you use LED&#8217;s to welcome Santa than if you use traditional incandescents.</p>
<p>I prefer to <a href="http://exampleofablog.com/hear-any-good-news-lately/">focus on the positive</a> and look for the best way to handle things. &#160;Maybe the best alternative for those wanting to create a new holiday look for their home is to await the after-Christmas sales and squeeze one more year out of the old incandescents.</p>

						<h2>What is Internet Marketing?</h2>
<p>Internet marketing is a huge marketing opportunity for anyone willing to learn and master the principles involved. If an individual has a product that people want to buy, a well-placed advertising campaign on the Internet will pay dividends.</p>
<p>Everyone is on the Internet it seems and for a small fish to <a href="http://exampleofablog.com/start-a-blog-and-get-your-voice-heard/">get noticed</a> in the big sea of Internet marketers is a big proposition, seemingly difficult to overcome. There are, however some strategies that do overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles.</p>
<p>The key to developing a way to market a product through Internet marketing is to either make a decision to hire someone who is an expert in this area, or learn how to do this yourself. Hiring a firm can be expensive, and there is no guarantee that the results will be to your liking. Testimonials are as good as the person that says they are good and unless you can speak directly to the person that gives the testimony, they are pretty much worthless.</p>
<p>So, if an individual is to take on this project him or herself, a learning curve must be overcome. Learning how to develop a website can be a bit intimidating, but a blog can be started immediately for nothing and the learning curve is small. Blogger.com is a good place to begin. They will walk anyone through the steps so they will be up and running very quickly.</p>
<p>Next, you need to find out where your market stands in comparison to the competition. <img class="size-medium wp-image-320 alignright" alt="internet marketing" src="http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/bryant_park_late_apr_2009__21-300x198.jpg" width="300" height="198" srcset="http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/bryant_park_late_apr_2009__21-300x198.jpg 300w, http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/bryant_park_late_apr_2009__21-226x150.jpg 226w, http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/bryant_park_late_apr_2009__21.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"/>The Google keyword tool (now the keyword planner) is your next stop in your Internet marketing adventure. This tool is free and will tell you what people are searching for on the search engines. Since most people use Google, that is a good benchmark to use.</p>
<p>So, let&#8217;s say that your product is fishing lures. Go to the keyword tool and type in &#8220;fishing lures&#8221;. You will see how many people are looking for that term in a month. Probably quite a few. You will probably need to narrow your search term down to the point where you have a good number of lookers, and not too many websites that are competition. You might try some varieties of fishing lures such as &#8220;deepwater lures&#8221;, or &#8220;night fishing lures for catching bass&#8221;.</p>
<p><object width="560" height="315" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"/><param name="src" value="//www.youtube.com/v/fVIxWnYmNaA?version=3&amp;hl=en_US"/><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"/><embed width="560" height="315" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="//www.youtube.com/v/fVIxWnYmNaA?version=3&amp;hl=en_US" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always"/></object></p>
<p>Once you find a keyword, or a keyword phrase that is being searched for from about 3,000 times a month and up, and the competition shows weak, then you have a winner. Build your blog around that keyword phrase. Try to incorporate the keyword phrase into the url, the title of the blog and use in two to three times in the body of the description of your blog. It is likely that the blog will eventually rank well in Google.</p>
<p>This is the main technique in attempting to gain an organic rank on a major search engine. Now you can keep learning by discovering other key words that rank in a similar way and build blogs around those keywords. When you have several <a href="http://exampleofablog.com/">blogs</a> pulling in traffic to sell your fishing lures, you might just have a good start on an Internet marketing business.</p>

						<p>Blogs started out as a sort of online journal for people looking for a place to share what was going on in their lives. &#160;Things have changed quite a bit since then. &#160;When you are choosing a main topic for your blog, you should avoid going too general and making a bunch of posts about random things. People won&#8217;t stay interested in your personal journal for very long unless you happen to be a very gifted writer with a very strong natural ability to entertain others with your stories.</p>
<p>Pick something that you can stay focused on without losing interest. If you choose a topic that you really have no interest in (based purely on potential readers or profits) you will only be buying yourself a long term pain in the neck that you probably will lose interest in before it ever has a chance of reaching its full potential. Building up traffic to your blog can be a lot of work and it can take a considerable amount of time before you start seeing consistent traffic. If you are writing about something you don&#8217;t really like, you&#8217;ll have a tough time keeping up a consistent publishing schedule.</p>
<p>Even though there are some people out there who will be interested in reading about your deepest inner thoughts, the people with money to spend will be looking to read about things like specific products or the latest technological advances. &#160;They probably won&#8217;t care about your Aunt Sally&#8217;s latest operation unless you can put an entertaining spin on the subject that helps them to relate the story to their own lives. &#160;You see, that is the secret right there. &#160;You&#8217;ve got to remember that we are all really just trying to look out for ourselves and the people close to us that we care about. &#160;It isn&#8217;t that all people are uncaring narcissists, it&#8217;s just that we all have a certain small circle of people and things that take up most of our attention and we tend to focus on those things. &#160;You&#8217;ve got to hit that sweet spot when you are writing something that you want other people to read and stay interested in. &#160;The time they spend reading your <a href="http://exampleofablog.com/">blog</a> is an investment of one of their most valuable resources&#8230; time. &#160;Make it a worthwhile transaction for them by making sure that they never feel like a visit to your blog was a waste of their time and you&#8217;ll be off to a good start.</p>

						<h1>Starting a Blog</h1>
<p>The online world is an ever changing place. What is hot today could be gone tomorrow (or at least not nearly as popular). Anyone remember how popular myspace was for a while? One thing that has stood the test of time is blogging. Yes, even with all of the current hype about social media, <a href="http://exampleofablog.com/">blogging</a> still stands out as a way to get your message out to the world.</p>
<div id="attachment_31" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-31 " alt="a blog needs focus" src="http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/are_you_ready-300x273.jpg" width="300" height="273" srcset="http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/are_you_ready-300x273.jpg 300w, http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/are_you_ready.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"/><p class="wp-caption-text">Your blog needs to be focused.</p></div>
<h2>Starting a Blog is Easy</h2>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have a <a href="http://exampleofablog.com/blog-personal-journal/">blog</a>, you might want to consider starting one. There&#8217;s never been a time in history when it was so easy for the common man or woman to share their thoughts and opinions with a worldwide audience. All you really need to get started is an interesting idea and the ability to put your thoughts down in written (or video) form. If you&#8217;ve got those two things, then you just need to make the leap and consider the actual nuts and bolts of building a blog. Don&#8217;t worry. It&#8217;s easy to get started.</p>
<h2>Getting Focused</h2>
<p>The internet is a busy place, so it&#8217;s generally a good idea to have a clear focus before you start your blog. What you&#8217;re looking for is a &#8220;niche&#8221;. You might want to think of it like starting a club. If you were starting a chess club, you&#8217;d focus on chess. Meetings would revolve around playing chess, discussing chess strategies, the history of chess. You get the idea. Well, your blog should have a focus too. Is it about dog training? Country living? Teen angst? Being middle aged? Pick something that interests you enough that you&#8217;ll be able to keep the content coming on a regular basis. Obviously, the focus of this blog (at least at this point) is the basics of starting and growing a blog. &#160;If I let the focus blur, or make the site too broad by adding a ton of different categories, search engines won&#8217;t know what to do with it. &#160;It could start to look like a generic article directory and I don&#8217;t want that. &#160;In order to establish &#8220;authority&#8221; online, you need a focus. &#160;Your niche should be your focus.<br/>

<h2>More about starting a blog</h2>
<p>Besides choosing a topic, you&#8217;ll also want to choose a method for building the actual blog. Some popular free choices today are Blogger and the <a href="http://wordpress.com/" target="_blank">free version of WordPress</a>. By the way, if you already have a <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a> account, you&#8217;re all set to start with Blogger. &#160;Just sign into your account, click on the drop down under your name in the upper right of the screen, click on &#8220;products&#8221; and choose &#8220;Blogger&#8221;. &#160;Although the set up is a little bit different, some people also like using <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Tumblr</a>. These are all great options for beginners, but the truth is, I&#8217;d avoid them if I was starting a blog that I planned on maintaining for the long haul. You see, they are both owned by third parties. In other words, someone else is going to have the last word about whether or not your blog is worthy of staying alive. If you write about a topic that they don&#8217;t like, they can simply refer to their Terms of Service and wipe your blog out instantly. I don&#8217;t like having that sword hanging over my head, so I buy my own domain name for about ten bucks per year and pay for a hosting plan. (I&#8217;ve used both Hostgator and Bluehost with good results).</p>
<h2>What will your blog look like?</h2>
<p>Fortunately, there are about a bazillion different themes that you can use when you publish a blog. This is like the &#8220;skin&#8221; of the website&#8230; What it actually looks like. Do you want something colorful or plain? Do you want a truckload of widgets in the sidebar showing off your latest posts, tweets, advertisements, and the like? This is something that you can change as your blog grows, so don&#8217;t worry about it too much at the beginning. Just choose something that looks good to you.</p>
<h2>Homework</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;ve decided to go ahead and start a blog of your own, then the next thing you need to do is make a list of things you&#8217;re interested in writing about. Whether you plan on making money with your blog, gaining support for a cause, or just entertaining people, you&#8217;ll want to choose something that holds your interest. Go ahead and do that, then stop back here for more blogging tips in the days ahead.</p>

<p><strong>Grab Up Those Glasses When You See Them!</strong><br/>
Kentucky Derby mint julep glasses have been a tradition at Churchill Downs since way back in 1938.&#160; Many people have started collecting these official mint julep glasses and some of the early ones are not only rare, they are quite valuable. I didn&#8217;t realize how valuable and collectible these glasses were at first. I have to admit that when I started researching them, I was a bit surprised to see that there are actually price guides written specifically for Kentucky Derby glasses.</p>
<p>So how much is a Kentucky Derby glass worth? Well, it can vary, but some are pretty pricey. I&#8217;m not talking about<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-480" src="http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/horse-race.jpg" alt="horse race" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/horse-race.jpg 300w, http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/horse-race-200x150.jpg 200w, http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/horse-race-150x112.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"/> ten or twenty dollars a glass.&#160; I&#8217;m talking very valuable as in hundreds of dollars for one vintage Kentucky Derby glass in some instances. &#160;If you have some old ones sitting on a shelf in your house, it might be worth your time to do a little bit of investigative work. &#160;A couple of the factors that can make these vintage glasses more valuable include scarcity (of course) and any kind of special features they may have (see the bakelite &#8220;glass&#8221; in the video below).&#160; Like so many other collectibles that are popular today, World War II shortages forced changes in production methods.&#160; That is another reason why some of the commemorative Kentucky Derby glasses from that decade are so valuable to collectors.<br/>
<object width="500" height="405" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"/><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/HDGUHAVzRnM&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x5d1719&amp;color2=0xcd311b&amp;border=1"/><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"/><embed width="500" height="405" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/HDGUHAVzRnM&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x5d1719&amp;color2=0xcd311b&amp;border=1" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always"/></object></p>
<p>In most cases, when I find any kind of commemorative glasses, I&#8217;m hesitant to spend too much on them.&#160; These are a definite exception for me.&#160; Even glasses from the 1990s have accumulated some value.&#160; Older Kentucky Derby souvenir glasses dating back to the first 20 years or so of production can be very valuable.&#160; An individual Kentucky Derby mint julep glass (that is ONE GLASS) from 1945 recently sold for $800.&#160; That was an exception, as two others from the same year also sold for less than $300 but I think the first one went for more because is was a rare &#8220;short&#8221; glass. The most recent &#8220;book&#8221; value I found for a 1940s Kentucky Derby glass was about $500, so two of those three folks did made out OK.&#160; You know what though, I would not be surprised if they all just keep on appreciating in value.&#160; Collectors at that serious about these and early ones are that hard to come by.&#160; I&#8217;ve found that purchasing glassware can be kind of a gamble unless you really know what you are doing, but I&#8217;d scoop these up in a heartbeat if I found them selling somewhere.</p>
<p>Of course that is the problem.&#160; You can find some of the more recent glasses at flea markets and yard sales, but it is very unlikely that you will ever find Kentucky Derby glasses from the 1940s through the 1960s being sold anywhere but a collectibles shop or an eBay auction. If you do happen to come across one of these vintage Derby glasses being sold at a rummage sale or flea market, be sure to grab it up before someone else spots it!</p>

<h2>Enjoy Your Day!</h2>
<p>Are you looking for a break from a busy daily routine? &#160;If so, you might have to actually schedule your alone time. &#160;Maybe you&#8217;re at a time in your life when you just don&#8217;t have very much to do, or people to do things with. &#160;Don&#8217;t fret. &#160;Make the most of your alone time. &#160;Maybe learning to meditate or developing a new skill would be more productive than dropping on to the couch and watching TV. &#160;What follows are some ideas to get you going.&#160; Please feel free to add to the list by leaving a comment!</p>
<h2>Relaxing Activities You Can Do By Yourself</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Make an online Spirograph.</strong> &#160;Do you remember that very cool art tool/toy that allowed even the most incompetent wannabe artist to make amazing doodles? &#160;I had a couple of them growing up and always managed to lose at least a couple of the little wheels! &#160;Now you can create a work of art at your very own computer. &#160;<a href="http://nathanfriend.io/inspirograph/" target="_blank">Check it out!</a></li>
<li><strong>Learn how to dance.</strong> &#160;This is a Youtube classic (with over 291 MILLION views). &#160;If you&#8217;ve never seen it, it&#8217;s a must watch! &#160;You might want to practice at home before going public with your own rendition.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;"><strong>Read a book.</strong> &#160;Give your imagination a workout. &#160;When you get into a really good book, you might be surprised at how much more enjoyable it is than watching the same re-hashed plots shown on television. &#160;Go low tech with a favorite paperback or download something to a tablet or e-reader (or even your phone). &#160;If you don&#8217;t have an e-reader, that&#8217;s no problem. &#160;Check this link to start reading Kindle books WITHOUT a Kindle! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/associates/AppDownload/?ref_=assoc_tag_ph_1402131685749&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=pf4&amp;program=1&amp;tag=homereview-20&amp;linkId=A5CHJAZW74D5RSTV" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon.com &#8211; Read eBooks using the FREE Kindle Reading App on Most Devices</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=homereview-20&amp;l=pf4&amp;o=1" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0"/><br/>

<p>twenty minutes can really change the way you are feeling. &#160;It&#8217;s a free way to give yourself a power boost and work out built up tension. &#160;Going somewhere different can keep things interesting.</p></li>
<li><strong>Think better.</strong> &#160;<a href="http://www.quantified-mind.com/" target="_blank">Quantified-mind.com</a> is a free site that allows you to work toward your peak mental performance. &#160;That&#8217;s a no-brainer!</li>
<li><strong>Improve your speaking skills.</strong> &#160;Have you ever wished that you were a better public speaker? &#160;Good news! &#160;You can take a free online public speaking course without any pressure to complete a final project in front of the class. &#160;<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-public-speaking-uwashingtonx-comm220x2" target="_blank">This class</a> is offered for free by the University of Washington and you can work at your own pace during your free time.</li>
<li><strong>Make someone&#8217;s day.</strong> &#160;You could do this a lot of different ways. &#160;Think of something you could spend a little bit of time doing that would make a positive difference in another person&#8217;s life. &#160;This doesn&#8217;t have to be expensive or complicated. &#160;Maybe you could write a letter or an email to a former teacher or a family member who had a positive effect on your life. &#160;We spend a lot of time complaining. &#160;Sometimes looking for positive things can make us feel a lot better.</li>
<li><strong>Take some free college classes.</strong> &#160;The internet has a lot of potential for good. &#160;This is a <a href="http://academicearth.org/online-college-courses/" target="_blank">collection of free college classes and lectures</a> that won&#8217;t cost you a dime in tuition. &#160;There are over 750 courses available to fill your free time.</li>
<li><strong>Create a list of the blessings in your life.</strong> &#160;I know it sounds hokey, but have you ever really tried this? &#160;Most of us spend way too much time complaining without realizing how good we actually have it compared to most of the world.</li>
<li><strong>Cook yourself a really good meal.</strong> &#160;There are tons of great recipes available for free on the internet today. &#160;Try something new. &#160;The New York Times offers a bunch of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/video/cooking-techniques/?ref=dining" target="_blank">free short videos</a> about various cooking techniques.</li>
<li><strong>Learn to draw.</strong> &#160;<a href="http://www.drawspace.com/" target="_blank">Drawspace</a> offers an amazing free collection of drawing lessons for anyone who wants to unleash their inner artist. &#160;There is also a paid option, but the free material should keep you busy for quite a while.</li>
<li><strong>Start a flower or vegetable garden.</strong> &#160;Once it&#8217;s up and running, taking care of it can be very relaxing. &#160;It will get you out into the sunshine and might even double as light exercise if you make it big enough.</li>
<li><strong>Watch a movie.</strong> &#160;I don&#8217;t watch that many movies, but I&#8217;ve got to admit that I love the whole concept of on demand movies that I can order and not have to return. &#160;Sometimes you just want to be mindlessly entertained. &#160;This is one of the things to do by yourself that you can also do with a friend without adding any social pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Start up an aquarium.</strong> &#160;You can get used aquariums for very low prices on sites like Craigslist. &#160;My advice for beginners would be to start with some simple, easy to care for, fish. &#160;If you love it, then consider getting in to something fancier. &#160;Tropical, salt water fish are pretty, but maintaining that kind of tank requires a LOT more work. &#160;If you just want to LOOK at some fish in a nicely set up aquarium, check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0933llkFoQ" target="_blank">virtual aquarium</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Give your dog a bath and then take it for a walk to dry it off.</strong> &#160;You won&#8217;t really be by yourself, but dogs are great companions. &#160;If you don&#8217;t have a dog, consider heading to an animal shelter to get yourself a new friend. &#160;Depending on what type of dog you have and your level of motivation, you might even want to <a href="http://exampleofablog.com/clippers-for-goldendoodle-grooming/">give your dog a haircut</a>!</li>
<li><strong>Watch some birds.</strong> &#160;I always thought that bird watching was sort of a strange way to pass the time, but when I started to actually look for the critters that were making all of the outside noises around my house, I was amazed at what I had been missing in my rush to get to the next activity. &#160;National Geographic has a helpful <a href="http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/birding/backyard-bird-identifier/" target="_blank">guide for identifying backyard birds</a> that you might find helpful.</li>
<li><strong>Volunteer.</strong> &#160;There are plenty of places in most communities that would love some extra help. &#160;This could be its own post titled &#8220;things to do by yourself that will make the world a better place and make you feel better about yourself&#8221;. &#160;Give it a try. &#160;Not sure where to start? &#160;<a href="https://www.volunteermatch.org/" target="_blank">Volunteermatch.org</a> can put you together with something that matches your interests.</li>
</ul>
<h2>More Things to Do on Your Own</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;"><strong>Try out a hobby.</strong> &#160;Go back to doing a forgotten hobby or get yourself a new one. &#160;If you&#8217;re stuck for an idea, check out Amazon&#8217;s massive list of &#8220;<a href="http://amzn.to/1I7sqAb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">for Dummies</a>&#8221; books. &#160;There are ton&#8217;s of hobby ideas just waiting to be found there (even if you don&#8217;t buy the book).</span></li>
<li><strong>Learn a new accent.</strong> &#160;Check out Youtube videos that teach you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=speak+with+an+accent" target="_blank">how to speak with a foreign accent</a>. &#160;Go out and try it somewhere.</li>
<li><strong>Clean a room in your house.</strong>&#160; Admit it. &#160;You know you feel better when you&#8217;re not surrounded by filth. &#160;This might not the most fun, but at least you&#8217;ll get a chore out of the way. &#160;If you need some helpful cleaning tips, <a href="http://www.homelife.com.au/how+to/top+40+best+ever+cleaning+tips,3675" target="_blank">try this list</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Do one thing that you have been avoiding.</strong> &#160;Having unfinished projects around is a major source of stress. &#160;Get some things handled and you&#8217;ll feel like a weight has been lifted from your shoulders. &#160;You should always start the day by getting the worst stuff out of the way. &#160;Once that&#8217;s done, everything else seems a lot less intimidating. &#160;Goal setting master Brian Tracy wrote a book called <a href="http://amzn.to/1R3XVgV" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eat That Frog</a> that explains this concept, and helps you to overcome that annoying procrastination habit. &#160;Unfinished business is <em>extremely</em> stressful.</li>
<li><strong>Learn to juggle.</strong> &#160;This is one of the things to do by yourself that you will really want to do by yourself. &#160;No distractions. &#160;You&#8217;ve got to concentrate. &#160;I taught myself by using a &#8220;for dummies&#8221; book. &#160;TIP: &#160;stand next to your bed while you practice so you don&#8217;t have to keep bending over to pick up dropped balls or beanbags.</li>

<li><span style="line-height: 13px;"><strong>Go fishing.</strong> &#160;Pack up your gear and go fishing for the day.</span></li>
<li><strong>Go bowling.</strong> &#160;Daytime rates usually aren&#8217;t too bad, and you won&#8217;t have to wait for a bunch of other people to take their turn. &#160;Don&#8217;t want to bowl? &#160;At least check out these <a href="https://youtu.be/CACAmH4r1fw" target="_blank">AMAZING TRICK SHOTS</a>.</li>

<li><strong>Take some photos.</strong> &#160;Break out your camera and take a bunch of photographs. &#160;Digital photography has made taking pictures and editing them a snap. &#160;Have some fun. &#160;Create a collage of what you did during the day. &#160;<a href="http://www.picmonkey.com/" target="_blank">Picmonkey.com</a> offers a bunch of cool FREE editing options. &#160;I use it all the time.</li>
<li><strong>Start a blog.</strong> &#160;Do you have an interest you could share with others? &#160;That&#8217;s a great starting place. &#160;Check out the front page of <a href="http://exampleofablog.com/">Example of a Blog</a>!</li>
<li><strong>Share your message with the world.</strong> &#160;Make a post on your blog and let people know about it. &#160;One of the coolest things about living in this internet age is that you can get your voice heard without getting into any kind of major media. &#160;The &#8220;little guy&#8221; actually has a voice now.</li>
<li><strong>Start a scrap book.</strong> &#160;Start with photos and stuff that&#8217;s in your junk drawer.</li>
<li><strong>Comment.</strong> &#160;Look for an interesting article on someone&#8217;s blog and make a quality comment. &#160;Feel free to start with this post by adding some YOU do to pass the time on a lonely Friday or Saturday night.</li>

<li><strong>Wash and wax your car.</strong> &#160;Get the oil changed too if it needs it.</li>
<li><strong>Call an old friend.</strong> &#160;Time can slip by in a hurry. &#160;Are you losing touch with old friends? &#160;Fix that.</li>

<li><strong>Plan a garage sale.</strong> &#160;List some of your old stuff on eBay. &#160;You might make more than a few bucks.</li>
<li><strong>Basic maintenance.</strong> &#160;Tighten all of the screws in your house. &#160;Change the filters in your furnace/AC.</li>

<li><span style="line-height: 13px;"><strong>Treat yourself.</strong> &#160;Go out and buy yourself a small treat somewhere (or get yourself a giant ice cream sundae).</span></li>
<li><strong>Go sit in a park.</strong> &#160;When is the last time you took some time to just relax on purpose without listing all of the things you need to get done?</li>
<li><strong>Skip some stones across a pond.</strong> &#160;This is becoming a lost art if you ask me. &#160;What is the most skips you&#8217;ve ever gotten out of one rock? &#160;<a href="https://youtu.be/Rv_IsDnzkaQ" target="_blank">Watch this</a> to see how it&#8217;s done by the world record holder for the most skips.</li>

<li><strong>Change your hair style or color.</strong> &#160;This isn&#8217;t right for everyone, but some people like to experience different looks as a way to shake things up and break out of old, boring routines. &#160;If you&#8217;re a woman and want to try a new look, take a photo of yourself and head over to this <a href="http://dailymakeover.com/virtual-makeover/" target="_blank">Daily Makeover</a> page.</li>

<li><strong>Visit a museum in your area.</strong> &#160;Go without a tour group so that you can really take your time and check things out.</li>
<li><strong>Cook something new.</strong> &#160;Most of us don&#8217;t get out of our food comfort zone too often.</li>
<li><strong>Go for a drive.</strong> &#160;Take your dream car out for a test drive. &#160;Here are <a href="http://www.quora.com/Automotive-Industry/Can-I-go-into-a-dealership-and-just-go-for-a-test-drive" target="_blank">some tips</a> for getting behind the wheel even if you are still in the &#8220;just looking&#8221; phase.</li>
<li><strong>Sort through old photos.</strong> &#160;If you have old family photos that are from the pre-digital era, scan them and share them with family and friends.</li>
<li><strong>Solve Rubik&#8217;s Cube</strong>. &#160;This thing has been giving me fits since the 80s! &#160;I remember watching people solve it on a show called That&#8217;s Incredible and wondering how the heck they did it. &#160;It turns out that the official Rubik&#8217;s Cube site actually has instructions with videos to help us out now. &#160;Check it <a href="https://rubiks.com/blog/how-to-solve-the-rubiks-cube-stage-2" target="_blank">here</a>. &#160;I still haven&#8217;t solved it, but maybe sometime soon.</li>
<li><strong>Work on a jigsaw puzzle.</strong> &#160;Personally, these things make me a little crazy, but I know a lot of people reach some sort of zen like state as they look over the pieces and try to find matching edges. &#160;If you like these puzzles, they&#8217;ll definitely help you to pass some time.</li>
<li><strong>Go to a batting cage or a driving range.</strong> &#160;Feeling a little stressed? &#160;Go whack some baseballs or golf balls around. &#160;It&#8217;s a great way to work off the stress of the day. &#160;Just don&#8217;t throw your back out if you haven&#8217;t moved away from your desk in a while.</li>
<li><strong>Learn how to catch coins off of your elbow.</strong> &#160;I remember seeing this on an old episode of Happy Days. &#160;I practiced and practiced and actually got pretty good at it after a while. &#160;<a href="https://youtu.be/S7eKGX4e45k" target="_blank">Here</a> is the world record of 55 quarters. &#160;I might go back into training &#8217;cause I think I&#8217;ve got a shot at this!</li>
<li><strong>Go retro.</strong> &#160;Visit an old fashioned diner or coffee shop. &#160;Think &#8220;non-trendy&#8221; here. &#160;Something that&#8217;s family owned and that doesn&#8217;t have franchises all over the world. &#160;If they have a counter with stools you can sit on, that&#8217;s even better.</li>
<li><strong>Meet an author.</strong> &#160;Does you local library or book store host book readings? &#160;If so, go check one out.</li>
<li><strong>Send an email to your future self.</strong> &#160;You can write to the future at <a href="https://www.futureme.org/" target="_blank">this site</a>. &#160;Pretty cool.</li>
<li><strong>Read something unusual.</strong> &#160;Check out <a href="http://www.theonion.com/" target="_blank">The Onion</a> or <a href="http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">Uncyclopedia</a>. &#160;They are both a little bit &#8220;different&#8221; to say the least. &#160;Even better, why not start your own satirical blog website if you&#8217;ve got a halfway decent sense of humor.</li>

						<h2>Finding Purpose: Life and what you should do with it.</h2>
<p>OK. &#160;So you know how sometimes you&#8217;re driving home from work and you have to pull into the nearest parking lot so that you can punch the steering wheel a bunch of times and scream things about your work being meaningless, your job sucking wind, the utter hopelessness of facing 20 more years in that place, and maybe something about how such a bunch of idiots ended up in management positions? &#160;Oh&#8230;yeah. &#160;Me neither.<br/>

<h2>What do you want to do with your life?</h2>
<p>No, Twisted Sister fans, the answer isn&#8217;t &#8220;I wanna rock!&#8221; (although I did show that video to my two older kids while I was writing this). &#160;The topic for the day is figuring out the riddle of living with purpose and how exactly to know what you are supposed to do with your life. &#160;I guess the short version of that would be, what is my calling? &#160;I figure I should be able to get that wrapped up in 400 words or so. &#160;Right? &#160;Seriously, this is something I personally have struggled with for about as long as I can remember. &#160;I think it all starts when you&#8217;re a kid and grown ups start asking you about a future you can&#8217;t even imagine yet. &#160;There you are, just 7 or 8 years old, and some well meaning adult plants &#8220;the question&#8221; in your brain&#8230; What do I want to do when I grow up? Hmmm. &#160;I&#8217;d love to go back in time and just flatly say, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m 8. &#160;How am I supposed to know what I want to be when I grow up when I don&#8217;t even know how to cook mac and cheese yet?&#8221; &#160;Seriously. &#160;But its too late for that now. &#160;The seed was planted long ago and it has grown over the years. &#160;I guess some people get a good answer for this question at some point. &#160;I kept waiting for it during my teens and twenties. &#160;It never came. &#160;I started actively looking for it in my late twenties and thirties. &#160;Still, it never came. &#160;I guess that might be part of why I never felt comfortable with any major in college and why I went through about ten years of having all sorts of different jobs. &#160;Too bad I didn&#8217;t have the idea for the show Dirty Jobs back in the nineties. &#160;I might have ended up on TV making car commercials like Mike Rowe.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m in my forties, I&#8217;ve had the same respectable job for 11 years, but honestly, I still often feel like I&#8217;m looking for that special purpose in life. I think I&#8217;m probably trying too hard. &#160;This morning I stumbled across a video that I&#8217;d like to share here. &#160;It may be a little bit &#8220;new agey&#8221; for some people reading this, but I think some of the advice is really solid. &#160;The thing that really caught my attention was the approach used to figure out what it is that you want in life. &#160;It makes so much sense, but I had never heard it suggested before.</p>
<p><object width="640" height="360" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"/><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/udOLJyDnE7k?version=3&amp;hl=en_US"/><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"/><embed width="640" height="360" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/udOLJyDnE7k?version=3&amp;hl=en_US" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allowscriptaccess="always"/></object></p>
<h2>Figuring out what you want</h2>
<p>OK, &#160;so if you watched that, maybe you came up with some good ideas for how to figure out what exactly it is that you want. &#160;Before I go any further, here is a link to the book written by Teal Scott (the woman in the video), just in case you were interested. It is called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1456747258/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1456747258&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=fulltimehours-20" rel="nofollow">The Sculptor in the Sky</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=fulltimehours-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1456747258" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0"/> and it&#8217;s on Amazon. &#160;Now what I found interesting was the idea of looking at what it is that you do NOT like and then working backward from that. &#160;I&#8217;m pretty darn clear on what I don&#8217;t like and I have been for as long as I&#8217;ve been working for other people. &#160; I&#8217;m keeping this list focused mainly on work issues for our purposes here. &#160; This is a partial list that I&#8217;m working with (how does it compare to yours?):</p>
<p><strong>Things I don&#8217;t like:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dealing with incompetent people</li>
<li>Bosses who are out of touch with the people they supervise</li>
<li>Working with the public in a customer service type of position</li>
<li>Traffic</li>
<li>Multi-tasking</li>
<li>Dealing with unpleasant people</li>
<li>Meetings</li>
<li>Committees</li>
<li>Being forced to join committees</li>
<li>Rules put forth by committees</li>
<li>Office politics</li>
<li>Having to enforce and follow rules that were made by politicians or committees that I think are counterproductive and ridiculous</li>
<li>Large groups of people, although surprisingly, public speaking doesn&#8217;t bother me a bit</li>
<li>Trading my hours away for money doing something that I dread on a daily basis and don&#8217;t enjoy in the least</li>
</ul>
<p>Just making this little list helped me to come up with some things that I do enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>Things I DO like:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Helping others</li>
<li>Writing and being creative</li>
<li>Meeting new people who aren&#8217;t jerks</li>
<li>Talking to and learning from other people</li>
<li>Working on my own with limited interruptions</li>
<li>Being in charge of my own productivity</li>
<li>Making my own work rules</li>
<li>Looking for and sharing ideas that make sense and help others</li>
<li>Keeping things uncomplicated (simplicity)</li>
<li>Bosses who ask for input and actually listen (although the idea of a boss still really rubs me the wrong way and I prefer being independent)</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>What do your lists look like? &#160;Please share them in the comments!</strong></em></p>
<h2>Who is making your choices?</h2>
<p>I think I&#8217;m making a good move with building websites. &#160;It lets me work at my own pace while still (hopefully) helping people and expressing myself while I do it. &#160;I&#8217;m sure that not every person will like what I post, but I don&#8217;t think anyone has ever managed to please all of the people all of the time, right? &#160;That brings me to another point&#8230;</p>
<p>It seems to me that we spend WAY too much time worrying about what other people will think of us if we do pursue our dreams. &#160;Ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you ever let someone change your mind about doing something that you were really excited about doing?</li>
<li>How about a dream that you had? &#160;Have you ever listened to someone when they told you that you were a dreamer and that you should do something practical instead of what you had your heart set on?</li>
<li>How many big decisions in your adult life were based on someone else&#8217;s idea of what you should do?</li>
</ul>
<p>That is life changing stuff. &#160;Good grief, when I look back on my life, I realize that I probably let other people direct me on those big decisions at least 90% of the time. &#160;That is what you call living someone else&#8217;s dream. &#160;Where are those people who influenced you so much nowadays? &#160;Are they doing substantially better than you? &#160;Have they ever come around to tell you how fabulous you are for following their sage advice? &#160;Many times, the people who have the most to say about you should be living your life, are pretty much clueless about how to run their own affairs. &#160;I forget who said it, but a quote that sticks with me goes something like don&#8217;t take advice from people who are worse off than you. &#160;That seems like a pretty good idea. &#160;In hindsight, I can see that the people who were telling me which path to take were completely miserable in their jobs. &#160;I&#8217;m sure they had the best intentions, but they sent me down the same unhappy path that they followed! &#160;Really, they were just pointing me toward the societal &#8220;norm&#8221;, but I have a real problem with just rolling over and accepting that as my fate. &#160;I suppose that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m here writing this now.</p>
<h2>Ask yourself some questions</h2>
<p>You&#8217;ve got to ask yourself the tough questions. &#160;What is my calling? (if you feel you have one.) &#160;What do I really want? &#160;What is my purpose on Earth? &#160;If it helps you, scream out &#8220;God &#8211; What do you want me to do?!?!&#8221;, then sit quietly for a while. &#160;Write down the thoughts that come to you. &#160;Answer the questions about what you like and don&#8217;t like. &#160;More and more I&#8217;m realizing that this is something really important that I should have done a long time ago before I ever took any kind of full time job that I thought might evolve into a career. &#160;Just writing this cleared up some things for me (thanks for reading along). &#160;Go now and take a little bit of time for yourself and see what you come up with. &#160;I, and a lot of other people, are living proof that if you don&#8217;t figure this stuff out, it doesn&#8217;t go away. &#160;You&#8217;ll just end up older and more frustrated. &#160;Don&#8217;t let that happen to you.</p>

						<p>If you are looking to give your patio and backyard some type of mood inducing illumination, your first step is to put up patio lights.&#160; However, these forms of lighting can be a stress on your budget, especially if you are trying to get something that fits your <a href="http://exampleofablog.com/interior-design-books/">sense of style</a> as well as functionality.&#160; If you are having trouble obtaining inexpensive and attractive lighting options, here are some tips on how to make patio lanterns on your own.<img class=" wp-image-294 alignright" alt="hanging patio lanterns" src="http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/lanterns__11-300x225.jpg" width="210" height="158" srcset="http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/lanterns__11-300x225.jpg 300w, http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/lanterns__11.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px"/></p>
<p><strong>Hanging Jar Lanterns:</strong> Fill cleaned glass jars with a variety of candles; the shapes and sizes of both of these can be varied by taste or just by what you happen to have on hand.&#160; Jars with a lip will work best, as you can then bend metal around the opening and hook it over to create a handle, much like an ornament.&#160; These can then be hung from wires or tree branches, and you can replace the candles whenever they run low.</p>

<p><strong>Touch Light Lamps:</strong> Touch lights are inexpensive lighting options that you can purchase at an office supply store and are easy to turn on and off.&#160; Create shades out of decorative paper squares, rolling them and fastening them around the touch lights.&#160; You can even cut attractive shapes out of the paper to cast fun shadows onto your patio. &#160;This can be a fun project to that will get the kids involved.<br/>
<strong><br/>
Concentrated Christmas Lights:</strong> Purchase strings of white (or colored, if you desire) lights during the Christmas season, when they are inexpensive.&#160; Wrap bunches of 10-15 little bulbs together and make a paper shade similar to the one mentioned above &#8212; just make sure the paper won&#8217;t touch the bulbs.&#160; Connect several strings together for more lights.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another neat idea that you might want to try around Halloween (or some time when you&#8217;re bored).</p>

						<h2>Do You Have a Family Budget?</h2>
<p>Most people, when put into the position of managing their family&#8217;s finances for the very first time find themselves struggling with the balancing of the family budget.&#160; Attempting to run a household without a plan in place can set the scene for a financially difficult situation.&#160; One person does not have to carry the load.&#160; It is perfectly acceptable to ask for the assistance of your family when putting the family budget together.</p>
<p><strong>Getting a Family Budget Makeover</strong></p>

<h2>Family Budgeting Includes Everyone</h2>
<p>Because in all probability, money will be getting spent by several family members, it only makes sense that everyone in the family should have a full understanding of how much money is available and how much each of them can reasonably spend without putting the family into financial difficulty.&#160; It would be wise to let every member of the family be aware of how much money there is and what limits apply to each of them.&#160; Children obviously will have stricter limits placed on them and their spending than an adult partner would have placed on them. &#160;This is also an opportunity to explain that everything from <a href="http://exampleofablog.com/how-to-make-patio-lanterns/">lights</a> to water costs the family money. &#160;This can lead to a discussion of the role each person in the family plays in how the family&#8217;s money gets spent.</p>
<p>As you start your family budgeting plan, it may be wise to set aside a predetermined amount of money that will be used as a family emergency fund.&#160; This money could be used for a variety of reasons but you must put limits on what this money can be used for so that it does not get spent frivolously.&#160; Some examples might be repairs needed on a major appliance or vehicle.&#160; Tapping the family fund in this case to avoid having to use credit cards with outrageously high interest rates only make sense.<img class="size-medium wp-image-304 alignleft" alt="Family budgeting" src="http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/george_is_keeping_an_eye_on_you-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/george_is_keeping_an_eye_on_you-300x200.jpg 300w, http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/george_is_keeping_an_eye_on_you-224x150.jpg 224w, http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/george_is_keeping_an_eye_on_you.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"/></p>
<p>Another key is to take stock of how much money is being spent on a regular basis by each family member so that you can look for places to save money or cut costs.&#160; Several family members spending even a couple of dollars per day on something like a cup of coffee or a bottle of soda pop can really add up over the span of the month.&#160; You may want to consider giving yourself and every family member a top limit which they can spend on a daily or weekly basis.&#160; Many times big financial difficulties can be traced to many small mistakes that are being made on a regular basis.&#160; It may be time to take a careful look at your spending and then spend a little bit of time crunching the numbers on your family budget.&#160; You may be surprised by what you find.</p>

						<p>I&#8217;m going to admit right up front that I have absolutely no desire to be in any kind of management or administrative position where I&#8217;d have to deal with a large number of employees. &#160;I give the people who take on that kind of role all kinds of credit. &#160;I would guess you&#8217;d have to have some pretty thick skin or an unbelievable desire for power and authority to go after something like that. &#160;Of course it could just be that the money is good. &#160;I&#8217;m still not interested. &#160;You&#8217;d always have people like me second guessing every move you make!<br/>

<h2>Tips from a non-manager</h2>
<p>Even though I don&#8217;t want a management position, I have no problem offering free advice and tips for managers from the perspective of an employee. &#160;I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time &#8220;being managed&#8221;, so I think I might have some worthwhile insights. &#160;I&#8217;m sure you do too, so feel free to add them in the comments section at the bottom of this post!<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-522" src="http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Managing-people.jpg" alt="managing people" width="300" height="208" srcset="http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Managing-people.jpg 300w, http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Managing-people-216x150.jpg 216w, http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Managing-people-150x104.jpg 150w, http://exampleofablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Managing-people-50x34.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"/></p>
<p>Today&#8217;s free tip is simple. &#160;Know when to back off a little bit. &#160;If you are in charge of a group of people, it is essential for you to realize that you can never really &#8220;manage&#8221; the actions of those people. &#160;The best you will be able to do with that approach is drive yourself crazy watching their every move like a hawk for eight hours every day. &#160;Who wants to do that? &#160;Rather than being a micromanaging dictator, try to learn a little bit about getting your employees motivated to do things on their own. &#160;I&#8217;ll write more posts about inspiring your employees to be self directed and motivated, but for right now, I want to mention a few things that you should NOT do to get what you want from the people working under you.</p>
<h2>Things you should not do if you are in a management type of position:</h2>
<ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t rule by fear</strong>. &#160;This is a great way to get yourself under the microscope. &#160;If you constantly threaten the people you are in charge of, you can bet that they will be more than happy to throw you under the proverbial bus the first time you mess up. &#160;No one likes being threatened and you will never get your employees to do any more than the least they can get away with. &#160;Being perfect is a full time&#160;job that you really don&#8217;t want.</li>
<li><strong>Stop micromanaging.</strong> &#160;Presumably, the people who were hired had some basic skills and qualifications when they were hired for the job. &#160;That means that they should be able to be trusted to think and perform on their own if they are given a little bit of room to move and function. &#160;If you hired incompetent people for the job, that is your fault. &#160;A decent hire should not need you looking over their shoulder and offering your input constantly. &#160;Let them show what they can do. &#160;When they do a good job, reward them. &#160;This might just be some verbal recognition, but it will go a lot further than standing over them and constantly butting in while they are trying to do a job. &#160;Micromanaging is also a great way to kill an employee&#8217;s creative spirit and any urge they have to improve themselves and their performance.</li>
<li><strong>Take responsibility.</strong> &#160;If you are the boss, don&#8217;t pass the buck. &#160;It&#8217;s OK if you screw up sometimes. &#160;You&#8217;re human. &#160;You might be surprised at how understanding people can be if you just admit that. &#160;On the other hand, if you mess up and everyone knows it, and you go on to blame someone else&#8230; Look out. &#160;You just lost the support and trust of everyone under your charge. &#160;When you signed on for that bigger paycheck and the private office, you also got a bunch of responsibility set squarely on YOUR shoulders. &#160;If your employees are messing up, look in the mirror first before you start blasting them.</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t forget where you came from.</strong> &#160;I realize that managers have to act differently when they move up through the ranks and gain authority. &#160;That is a lame excuse though for managers who forget what their former job was actually like. &#160;If you can remember how difficult it was to keep up with a huge amount of paperwork while still trying to perform your job well, why in the world would you dump more paperwork on the people you are now managing? &#160;I remember hearing a lot of talk about becoming a paperless society a while back. &#160;I don&#8217;t know about you, but it seems to me that the paperwork seems to actually be increasing nowadays.</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t play favorites.</strong> &#160;Maybe some management types don&#8217;t, but I think they&#8217;re pretty rare. &#160;If you have a favorite, the rest of your employees probably know about it. &#160;This can seriously damage any type of respect people in the office have for you.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>I don&#8217;t have a business degree, so some people will read this and just shake their head thinking that I&#8217;m clueless about the art of management. &#160;The thing is, when you are in management, you ignore the thoughts and feelings of employees at your own peril. &#160;If you aren&#8217;t sure if you have been doing any of the above things, just go ask someone who works in your office. &#160;If they look uncomfortable when you ask, you have your answer and you don&#8217;t even need to force them into an answer.</p>
